        <h4> Description </h4>

        <p>Virtually all digital communications infrastructure relies on cryptography for security. While crypto is essential, it's also extremely brittle --- any coding error or mistake in a security proof can compromise the entire system's security.
        Since cryptographic security can have such high stakes, it's a perfect fit for
        techniques from PL (e.g., type systems and theorem
        provers), which can deliver provable, <em>fully formal</em> security guarantees.</p>
        <p>This seminar will cover the science and practice of building cryptographic code
        with formally proven security guarantees. We will cover the &quot;full stack&quot;,
        ranging from cryptographic security for complex protocols (e.g., TLS and secure VPNs), to the security of their underlying cryptographic algorithms (e.g.,
        symmetric ciphers and elliptic curves) and associated
        high-performance implementations in C and assembly.</p>
        <p>The intended audience is graduate students with an interest in formal methods or applied cryptography, and will consist of lectures, student-led paper presentations,
        and a course project. The course will assume some amount of programming experience, and
        familiarity with concepts from programming languages (e.g., operational
        semantics, type systems, and first-order logic); supplemental background reading will be supplied as well. There is no formal textbook requirement for the course.</p>

        <h3 id="background">Background Reading</h3>
        <p>
        An understanding of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC) will 
        be useful, to understand the papers we will read in class. 
        To read up on this, I recommend Chapters 1-3, 5, 8-9, and 11 of Benjamin Pierce's textbook 
        <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html">Types and Programming Languages</a>.
