        <h2>Background Materials</h2>

        <h4 style="text-align: left";> Programming Language Foundations</h4>
        <p>
        An understanding of the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus (STLC) will 
        be useful for those papers which use the language of PL. 
        To read up on this, I recommend Chapters 1-3, 5, 8-9, and 11 of Benjamin Pierce's textbook 
        <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html">Types and Programming Languages</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h4 style="text-align: left";> Cryptographic Background </h4>
        <p>
        This class will mostly deal with "ordinary" cryptography, including symmetric encryption schemes, digital signatures, 
        and hash functions. As a reference, you can take a look at the below resources:
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://joyofcryptography.com">The Joy of Cryptography</a>, particularly chapters 2, 4, 6, 7, and 12-14; </li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html">
                    Introduction to Modern Cryptography</a>; </li>
            <li> <a href="https://toc.cryptobook.us">
                    A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography </a> </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 style="text-align: left";> Verification </h4>
        This class will touch upon <em>formal verification</em>, which uses 
        software tools to conduct mathematically precise proofs about programs. 
        If you haven't had experience with formal verification, I recommend taking a look below:
        <ul>
            <li> <b>SAT/SMT-based tools</b>. These tools, such as <a href="https://dafny.org/latest/OnlineTutorial/guide">Dafny</a>,
                analyze programs by exporting <em>verification conditions</em> to automatic theorem provers, 
                such as <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki">Z3</a>.
            <li> In contrast, <b>type theory-based tools</b> such as <a href="https://coq.inria.fr">Coq</a> or <a href="https://lean-lang.org">Lean</a> 
                present general-purpose, foundational tools for mathematical reasoning, which can then be used to analyze programs 
                (among other tasks).
            </li>
        </ul>
