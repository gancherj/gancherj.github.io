        <h4> Description </h4>

        <p>Virtually all digital communications infrastructure relies on cryptography for security. While crypto is essential, it's also extremely brittle --- any coding error or mistake in a security proof can compromise the entire system's security.
        Since cryptographic security can have such high stakes, it's a perfect fit for
        techniques from PL (e.g., type systems and theorem
        provers), which can deliver provable, <em>fully formal</em> security guarantees.</p>
        <p>This seminar will cover the science and practice of building cryptographic code
        with formally proven security guarantees. We will cover the &quot;full stack&quot;,
        ranging from cryptographic security for complex protocols (e.g., TLS and secure VPNs), to the security of their underlying cryptographic algorithms (e.g.,
        symmetric ciphers and elliptic curves) and associated
        high-performance implementations in C and assembly.</p>
        <p>The intended audience is graduate students with an interest in formal methods or applied cryptography, and will consist of lectures, student-led paper presentations,
        and a course project. The course will assume some amount of programming experience, and
        familiarity with concepts from programming languages (e.g., operational
        semantics, type systems, and first-order logic); supplemental background reading will be supplied as well. There is no formal textbook requirement for the course.</p>

        <h3 id="grading">Assignments and Evaluation </h2>
        After an initial set of lectures, the course will consist of paper discusions
        and a final project. The course grade will be determined by:
        <ul>
            <li> 20% in-class participation; </li>
            <li> 40% written paper reflections; and </li>
            <li> 40% a final course project. </li>
        </ul>
        All graded material will be submitted via <a href="http://canvas.northeastern.edu">Canvas</a>.

        <h4 style="text-align: left;"> Paper Reflections </h4>
        For each paper we read, you will submit <a href="paper-questions.txt">a paper reflection</a>, in the form of a questionnaire, via Canvas.
        Each paper's reflection will be due by 11:59 PM the day before the class that we read the paper. 
        Please spend some time to think critically about your answers! 

        <p>
            You may skip up to <b>four</b> paper reflections for free.    
        </p>

        <h3 id="background">Background Reading</h3>
        The readings for this class will utilize a mix of ideas from PL, verification, security, and cryptography.
        If you are interested, see <a href="background.html">here</a> for some suggested background reading.

        <h3 id="policies"> Class Policies </h3>

        <h4 style="text-align: left;"> Academic Integrity Policy </h4>
        For paper reflections, you are to complete them <b>by yourself</b>, with no feedback from others or AI assistants.

        For the final project, 
        you are free to build upon the work of prior papers and open-source projects with the appropriate citations.
        In particular, any code or text not written by you personally must be cited.
        Minor coding tasks and grammar cleanup by AI is allowable, but must be cited. 
        You may incorporate feedback from others outside of your group with appropriate citations as well. 

        <h4 style="text-align: left;"> Accommodations for Disabilities</h4>
        Students who wish to receive academic services or accommodations should visit the <a href="https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu">Disability Access Services</a>.
        Please provide a letter from the DAS to me early in the semester so that I can arrange the appropriate 
        accommodations.
